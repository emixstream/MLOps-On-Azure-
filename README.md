# MLOps-On-Azure-

For the University course Technological Infrastructures for Data Science my team has chosen to address
the innovative and very interesting topic of machine learning operations. 
Every good Data Engineer/ Data Scientist should know well how to deploy (edit, validate, optimize) and distribute
Machine Learning related code and applications on the cloud.

In this case we chose Azure, a very neat and powerful cloud platform to integrate machine learning pipelines that allow full 
collaboration between data scientists, data engeneers, operational engineers, softwer testers, business experts,
analysts and managers. 

I take a boiler plate classification application, (dataset Iris :/) and deploy it into azure cloud. 
Here you can have a look at all the CLI commands, Bash scripting and the python boiler plate code with 
impelemnted test and config files.

Dev Ops with machine learning can really speed up the process that leads from data to economic value! All the stake holders are involved.
Performance with machine learning integration has no limits other than the costs a company is willing to invest in big data management!!

Feel free to reach out for any question!!!
